<h2>Adding pages</h2>
<p>If you want to add a page, you can just create a new markdown file in the pages folder and in the frontmatter give it a title, permalink, and a date. The dates are arbitrary and don't display anywhere but control the order in which the pages show up in the navigation. It's a little hacky but hey.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">---
title: New Page
date: to go last put a date after 2022-01-05
permalink: &quot;/newpage/&quot;
---
</code></pre>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>Images are being optimized for quick loading on small screens so instead of standard HTML like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;img src=&quot;blahblahblah.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alternate text&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Images will look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nunjucks">{% image &quot;blahblahblah.jpg&quot;, &quot;alternate text&quot; %}
</code></pre>
<p>This is calling an 11ty shortcode to create the optimized images. In the off chance that this gives you any trouble down the line, you can just use normal HTML tags and as long as the image you are referencing is in the /assets/images/ folder it should work.</p>
<h2>Styles / CSS</h2>
<p>You can edit styles in /css/style.css. Some obvious things you may want to tweak are right at the top, like fonts and colors.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">:root {
    /* edit colors here */
    --font-color: #515151;
    --subtitle-color: #c0c0c0;
    --link-color: #268bd2;
    --current-page-color: #bb5e32;

    /* set font */
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
</code></pre>
